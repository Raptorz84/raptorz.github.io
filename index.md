## Simulated Risk Assesment

### Incident Report for Brute Force Attack
> Documentation for an attack on an E-comemrce company and the next steps to take. I analyzed a real-world attack scenario involving DNS and HTTP protocols. The attack was initiated through a brute-force compromise of a website's admin credentials, enabling the attacker to inject malicious redirects onto the website. This led to malware infections on users’ devices. Using Wireshark, I captured and analyzed network traffic to identify the exploitation method and track DNS requests leading to the malicious domain. This project reinforced my understanding of network forensics and intrusion detection while demonstrating my ability to investigate and mitigate cyber threats effectively.

### Incident Handler's Journal 
> In this project, I documented and analyzed multiple cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, and malware infections. Using structured analysis such as the 5 W’s of incident analysis, I detailed each attack’s execution and impact as well as the possible mitigation strategies. Tools like Wireshark and VirusTotal were used to investigate malicious files and network activity. This project strengthened my ability to perform threat analysis, and incident response reporting, showcasing my skills in identifying, documenting, and mitigating cyber threats.

### Incident Report for SYN Flood Attack
> In this project, I investigated a SYN flood attack that disrupted a company’s DNS services. Using Wireshark, I analyzed network traffic and identified an excessive number of SYN requests overwhelming port 53, preventing legitimate users from accessing the website. Through packet capture analysis, I confirmed the characteristics of a DoS attack, demonstrating my ability to detect and analyze network-based threats. This hands-on experience strengthened my skills in intrusion detection and threat analysis, preparing me for real-world cybersecurity incident response scenarios.
